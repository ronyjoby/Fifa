**Installation**

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

Project Motivation
This is an Udacity Nanodegree project. I chose FIFA 19 complete player dataset.
As a football fan, it would be quite interesting to apply data analysis skills here.

**My key interests would be:**

What's the ratio of total wages/ total potential for clubs. Which clubs are the most economical ？
What’s the age distribution like? How is it related to the player’s overall rating?
How is a player's skills set influence his potential/wage? Can we predict a player's potential based on his skills' set?

**File Descriptions**

Data.csv contains latest edition FIFA 2019 player’s attributes including age, potential, wage, etc.
There is also a notebook available here to showcase all my work related to my three questions.

**Results**
The main findings of the code can be found at the [post](https://medium.com/@ronyjoby/football-performance-vs-money-e8b9f3a5b9aa) available
